# My-demo
**U2-Net: U Square Net**
- official repo of U2-Net: https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net
- In this demo U2-Net is used for portrait drawing

**Virtual environment was created with the help of *poetry*:**
- to install *poetry* according to your OS visit: https://python-poetry.org/docs/
- if you install *poetry* using **pip**, be aware that it will also install Poetryâ€™s dependencies which might cause conflicts with other packages


**Task 1**

**Follow these steps to run the project:**
 1. Go to My-demo directory
 2. Activate virtual envirnonment with `poetry run`
 3. Run `python demo.py` (can be different according to your OS)
 4. You will see the result of portrait drawing based on the test photo
 5. Then press *exit* to leave the shell
 
 
**Task 2**

**To be able to build a package from the code:**
1. `poetry build`
2. cd ./dist
3. pip install <source file> (`pip install demo-0.1.0.tar.gz`)
4. to watch demo you can run `python demo.py`

**USE** `pip install git+https://github.com/whatswrongwithyourmitochondria/My-demo`
to install a package from the console 

**Task 3**

 - Styling tools such as *black* and *pylint* were added.
 - *pre-commit* tool is used while making commits and has been configured to use styling tools mentioned above. 

 - to install all the necessary packages, run `poetry install`

**Before commit**

 * to format the code with the help of *black* tool, run `black demo.py`
 * to check the list of errors with the help of *pylint* tool, run `pylint demo.py`

 to run all style checking tools at once:
 
 - once run `pre-commit install .`
 - every time you want to check your code with help of all styling tools, run `pre-commit run -a`

 After you fix all the errors, make *git add / git commit* commands again. 

 **Task 4**

 In this task 2 tests are added:
  - visual regression test, that checks our results are always the same
  - a "no error" test, that shows our algorithm works with the images of different sizes
